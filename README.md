=============

Coding conventions follow google C++ style guide:
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

Currently, riemann_solver.cpp, slope_limiter.cpp are not implemented. 
The code is only a setup of the numerical grids based on a cell-interface 
datastructure.

Physical parameters relevant to the specific physical systems are to be added.
